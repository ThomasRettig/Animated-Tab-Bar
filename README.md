# Animated Tab Bar
A simple porting of abxlfazl khxrshidi’s Animated Tab Bar code onto Github. The code is a faithful reproduction of Mauricio Bucardo’s original Dribble Shot, which you may find here: https://dribbble.com/shots/5619509-Animated-Tab-Bar

The code in this repository has been modified a bit. To view the original code, go here: https://codepen.io/abxlfazl/pen/VwKzaEm

### Note
There is a small bug in which the buttons overflow when viewed on a mobile viewport.
