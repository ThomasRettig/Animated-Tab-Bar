# Animated Tab Bar
A simple porting of abxlfazl khxrshidi’s Animated Tab Bar code onto Github. The code is a faithful reproduction of Mauricio Bucardo’s original Dribble Shot, which you may find here: https://dribbble.com/shots/5619509-Animated-Tab-Bar

The code in this repository has been modified a bit. To view the original code, go here: https://codepen.io/abxlfazl/pen/VwKzaEm

I like how SVG animations are cleverly used to animate the menu buttons. Awesome!
